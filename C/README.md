### gremlin.c

The program replaces every 'g' character it finds with "gremlin" and every 'G' with "GREMLIN".

### rgb.c

The program reads a collection of triplets from the keyboard and keeps them in a linked list.  The first number is saved in "r", the second in "g" and the third in "b" fields of the node (as in Red, Green, Blue).
When the sentinel triplet is received (-1, -1, -1) (-2, -2, -2) or (-3, -3, -3), then Column 1 (r-field), Column 2 (g-field), or Column 3 (b-field) is processed for finding the max in that column.

### toUppercase.c

Converts a string to uppercase.
